The pipeline described in the notebook has been reimplemented from DL4Proteins demonstration, it integrates three key tools—RFDiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold—to design proteins with specific objectives. Here's how it works:
1.	RFDiffusion:
•	This is a diffusion-based generative model that creates protein backbones by denoising 3D Gaussian noise. It generates the structural framework (or backbone) of proteins without amino acid sequences.
•	It supports tasks like:
•	Unconditional Diffusion: Generating random protein backbones.
•	Motif Scaffolding: Extending or connecting specific regions of a protein while preserving functional motifs.
•	Binder Design: Designing proteins that interact with specific regions (hotspots) of another protein.
2.	ProteinMPNN:
•	A graph neural network (GNN) that assigns amino acid sequences to the backbone generated by RFDiffusion. It predicts sequences likely to fold into the given structure, ensuring compatibility between sequence and structure.
3.	AlphaFold:
•	A structure prediction tool used to validate the designed protein sequence. It checks whether the predicted folded structure matches the original backbone, ensuring design feasibility.
Example Use Cases:
•	Unconditional Diffusion: Generate random proteins for statistical analysis or exploratory research.
•	Motif Scaffolding: Stabilize or extend known functional regions of proteins.
•	Binder Design: Create novel proteins that bind to specific targets for therapeutic or experimental purposes.
